# Note: Configuration files are read system-wide from /etc/mpv and per-user from ~/.config/mpv (unless the environment variable XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set), 
# where per-user settings override system-wide settings, all of which are overridden by the command line. 
# User specific configuration is suggested since it may require some trial and error.

# General settings #
####################

# Start in fullscreesn mode by default.
# fs=yes


# Force starting with centered window.
# geometry=50%:50%


# Don't allow a new window to have a size larger then 90% of the screen size.
# autofit-larger=90%x90%


# Do not close the window on exit.
keep-open=yes


# Do not wait with showing the video window until it has loaded. (This will
# resize the window once video is loaded. Also always show a window with
# audio.)
# force-window=immediate


# Disable the On Screen Controller (OSC).
# osc=no


# Keep the player window on top of all other windows.
ontop=yes


# Disable hardware decoding (hwdec=no).
# Enable hardware decoding if available (hwdec=auto). Often, this does not work with all
# video outputs, but should work well with default settings on most systems.
# If performance or energy usage is an issue, forcing the vdpau or vaapi VOs
# may or may not help.
hwdec=no


# Specify high quality video rendering preset (for --vo-gpu only)
# Can cause performance problems with some drivers and GPUs.

#     dither-depth=auto
#     correct-downscaling=yes
#     sigmoid-upscaling=yes
#     deband=yes
profile=gpu-hq


# Choose gpu-api:
#
# macOS:   opengl.
# Linux:   vulkan or opengl, "vulkan" is recommended.
# Windows: vulkan, d3d11 or opengl.

# http://bbs.vcb-s.com/thread-2730-1-1.html
gpu-api=vulkan


# Selects the internal format of textures used for FBOs. The format can influence performance and quality of the video output.
# Default: auto, which first attempts to utilize 16bit float (rgba16f, rgba16hf), and falls back to rgba16 if those are not available.
fbo-format=rgba32f

# Screenshot #
##############

# Output format.
screenshot-format=png


# Tag screenshots with the appropriate colorspace. Note that not all formats are supported. Default: no.
screenshot-tag-colorspace=yes


# Same output bit-depth as the video. Set it "no" if you want to save disc space.
screenshot-high-bit-depth=yes


# Compression of the PNG picture (0-9). Higher value means better compression. The default is 7.
screenshot-png-compression=0


# Set the filter applied prior to PNG compression. 0 is none, 1 is "sub", 2 is "up", 3 is "average", 4 is "Paeth", and 5 is "mixed". For most images, "mixed" achieves the best compression ratio, hence it is the default.
screenshot-png-filter=0


# Output directory.
screenshot-directory="\tmp"



##########
# Dither #
##########

# Set the size of the dither matrix (default: 6).
# The actual size of the matrix is (2^N) x (2^N) for an option value of N, so a value of 6 gives a size of 64x64.
# The matrix is generated at startup time, and a large matrix can take rather long to compute (seconds).
dither-size-fruit=7

# Interpolation #
#################

# Force video to lock on the display's refresh rate, and change video and audio
# speed to some degree to ensure synchronous playback - can cause problems
# with some drivers and desktop environments.
video-sync=display-resample


# Maximum speed difference in percent that is applied to video with --video-sync=display-... (default: 1).
# The default settings are not loose enough to speed up 23.976 fps video to 25 fps. We consider the pitch change too extreme to allow this behavior by default. Set this option to a value of 5 to enable it.
# video-sync-max-video-change=5


# Activate interpolation for smooth motion

# Interpolation method.
#
# Common --tscale choices include oversample, linear, catmull_rom, mitchell, gaussian, or bicubic. These are listed in increasing order of smoothness/blurriness, with bicubic being the smoothest/blurriest and oversample being the sharpest/least smooth.
